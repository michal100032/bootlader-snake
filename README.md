# Bootlader snake
Very basic implementation of the classic game Snake written in x86 assembly that fits into the 512 byte long boot sector.

To run the game first clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:michal100032/bootloader-snake.git
cd bootloader-snake
```
And then to run the project with `qemu`:
```
make run
```
